Johnny-Five is an open source Arduino programming framework, written in JavaScript, that runs on the Node.js platform.


An open source enthusiast and JavaScript evangelist; I am currently an active member of ECMA/TC39 (the committee responsible for the future of the JavaScript language), as well as a core committer for both jQuery and Popcorn.js.



Johnny-Five is an open-source JavaScript Arduino programming framework that runs on the Node.js platform. Built on top of node-serialport, using the Firmata communication protocol (node-firmata), Johnny-Five provides a high-level API for programming hardware applications. During the development of Johnny-Five, I've kept a running collection of video demonstrations, a selection of which are linked to from the github repo (https://github.com/rwldrn/johnny-five).


In 2012, I spoke at three seperate conferences, two of which are available for viewing:

- NodeConf, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jf-cEB3U2UQ (Slides: http://javascriptrobots.com)
- CascadiaJS, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT2e4QLGDLs
- EmpireJS, No video available












 Node gave three seperate talks
Additionally, I spoke at this years NodeConf and gave a live demonstration of a robot capable of navigating obstaclesâ€”programmed completely in JavaScript. Slides for the presentation are available at http://javascriptrobots.com and video at http://2012.nodeconf.com/theatre/rick_waldron.html or http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jf-cEB3U2UQ .

In late July, I even proposed to my girlfriend with the help of a robot that I programmed with the Johnny-Five API. This past week, I reached a milestone where I programmed a biped to walk freely: http://jsfiddle.net/rwaldron/WZkn5/show/light/ (video and code).



I'd like to purchase a supply of standard servos (0-180, 0-90, 360 degree controlled position motors), standard brackets (C, L and servo), load balancing springs, foot panels, foot panel bumpers, gripper units, IR motion and range units, sonar range units, microcontroller boards (arduino, etc), board mounts, standoffs and servo wiring extension rigs.
